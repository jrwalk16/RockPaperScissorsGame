# RockPaperScissorsGame
This project involves a player going against the computer in a game of rock, paper, scissors.
 The main menu also includes a feature that lets the user calculate a winning percentage of how many games they played.
 
 
This project meets the following requirements:

#Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
(loops used in Game and WinPercentage methods)

#Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
(WinPercentage method allows users to take information about how many games played and converts to a percentage of games won)

#Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
(game tracks scores of the player and computer until one reaches 5 wins. 
The game also tracks how often the computer selects rock, paper or scissors to aid the player in making a decision.)
